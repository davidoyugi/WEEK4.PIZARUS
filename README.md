# WEEK4.PIZARUS
This project basically shows how html,css and javascriot can be incorporated
to show how a webpage can function

the page is divided into different parts
Home
about us
menu
contacts

therefore when someone enters the landing page he is able to order pizza,
differnt flavours
different sizes
different crust types

It then asks whether you want a delivery or not and notifies the user the costs of al these variables.

The user is then able to order
